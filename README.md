# VIdeo-Enhancement

## TASK

The primary goal of this assignment is to showcase your proficiency in developing an
advanced AI model capable of enhancing the quality of a video by upscaling its
resolution and reducing noise. Your task entails harnessing the capabilities of any
suitable and available model to achieve significant improvements in video quality,
particularly by increasing its resolution and eliminating unwanted noise.
Essentially, we want you to demonstrate something that imitates this tool in video
enhancement: https://tensorpix.ai/
(Example: The input video will contain a lip-synced video of a person speaking in a
different language, since this is generative video, the area around the lips is pixelated
and contains noise. Upscale it, so the blur and pixelation goes away)
